# Conditional Statements
# Syntax

#indentation is very important in Python

# if condition:
    # Code block
# elif another_condition:
    # Code block
# else:
    # Code block

# Example
age = int(input("Enter your age: "))

if age < 18:
    print("You are a minor.")
elif 18 <= age <= 65:
    print("You are an adult.")
else:
    print("You are a senior citizen.")


# Logical Operators

x = 4

if age > 18 and age < 30:
    print("Young adult")
    
if age == 25 or age == 50:
    print("Jubilee Celebration")

print("\n================================")
gender = str(input("Enter your gender: "))

if age == 25:
    if gender == "male":
        print("You should be a dad by now")
        if x == 4:
            print("You should have four kids by now")
    elif gender == "female":
        print("You should be a mom by now")
else:
    print("You should be happy with yourself")
